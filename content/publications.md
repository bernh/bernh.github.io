## University

A tutorial on LDPC (Low Density Parity Check Codes): 
[LDPC Codes - a brief Tutorial](/media/download/papers/ldpc.pdf)

This document has been the number one Google hit for **LDPC tutorial** for more
than 10 years now and I received quite a lot of positive feedback from students 
all over the world on it. And a lot of requests to help with their homework.
This is probably the most useful thing I have ever written:
