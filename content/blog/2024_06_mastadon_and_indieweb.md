Recently re-read some articles and posts about the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)
movement and briefly thought about re-writing this site again from scratch to 
consider their [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) advice. And maybe use a real CMS
instead of a static site generator.

Luckily I didn't pull the trigger immediately and nuked this page because I realized
that I'm perfectly fine with some stuff I write not fully under my control and potentially
vanishing in the future. Not everything is worth to be archived here. Actually, almost 
nothing is, as you can immediately notice when looking at the frequency of my blog posts.
For the moment Mastadon feels like the right platform to use for short term communication.

And of course for linking to this blog whenever I feel like it. This brings me to some 
other aspect: including potential comments on Mastadon back on this site. I found some 
nice samples how to integrate this with zola but I will skip this. Will check if I can 
just add a comment counter here and link to Mastadon. This sounds actually like a good idea.
