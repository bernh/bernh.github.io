I was pretty exited when I managed to get my gmail adress back in November 2004.
At this point of time invitations (yes, gmail was invite only for a couple of 
months) have been highly desired. I switched from an [GMX](https://www.gmx.com) 
account with something like 10 or maybe 50 MBs of mailbox size and the 1 GB 
offering from google was just amazing. 

After having the same email adress for almost 20 years I don't really see an
option to completely move on. I could of course automatically forward everything
to a new adress but so far I decided on a differnt approach:

- create new @bernh.net mailboxes
    - one for official stuff connected to banking and government services
    - one new main account for personal emails
    - one for "important" and accounts. 
- keep the rest on gmail for now and only gradually move stuff over if I somehow 
  consider it relevant.
    - gmail will be kept forever at very least for throw-away accounts

Not 100% satisfied here but practicality beats purity here.
